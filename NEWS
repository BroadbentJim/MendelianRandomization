MendelianRandomization v0.4.0
=============================
Added multivariable MR-Egger method (mr_mvegger)
Added contamination mixture method (mr_conmix)
Added seamless integration with PhenoScanner via the pheno_input function

MendelianRandomization v0.3.0
=============================
Added mr_mvinput and mr_mvivw for multivariable Mendelian randomization
Added mode-based estimation method of Hartwig et al (mr_mbe) and heterogeneity-penalized mode-based method (mr_hetpen)

MendelianRandomization v0.2.2
=============================
Penalization of weights altered to correspond to Rees et al 2017 (submitted): penalization is now about the median estimate, only variants with heterogeneity p-value less than 0.01 are penalized.

New functionality on mr_plot command: static graph (new options "interactive" and "labels").
New command mr_maxlik: implements maximum-likelihood estimation method.
Bug fixes on mr_allmethods command.
